"""
End-to-End tests for NeoAlchemy.

E2E tests verify complete user workflows and scenarios, including:
- Multi-step operations across components
- Complex graph traversal scenarios  
- Performance testing across full stack
- AI agent interactions (for MCP component)

These tests are the slowest and most comprehensive, testing the entire
system as a user would interact with it.
