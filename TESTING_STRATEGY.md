# NeoAlchemy Testing Strategy Implementation Plan

## Overview
Goal: Implement unit, integration, and e2e tests that run reliably both locally and in CI.

## Current State Issues
- Unit tests can access real database (mixed boundaries)
- Missing integration test layer
- CI unfriendly setup (hardcoded connections)
- Slow test execution even for basic runs

## Target Architecture

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast (0.5s), no dependencies, pure logic
├── integration/    # Medium (5s), real database, component interaction  
└── e2e/           # Slow (30s), full stack, user scenarios
```

## GitHub Issues (Execution Order)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Dependencies: None)
- Issue #X: Separate unit tests from database dependencies
- Issue #Y: Create integration test structure  
- Issue #Z: Add test containers for reliable database setup

### Phase 2: Test Organization (Dependencies: Phase 1)
- Issue #A: Reorganize existing tests into proper categories
- Issue #B: Create CI workflow for all test types
- Issue #C: Add test performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Dependencies: Phase 2)  
- Issue #D: Add missing test coverage
- Issue #E: Optimize test execution speed
- Issue #F: Documentation and developer onboarding

## Success Metrics
- Unit tests: <1 second execution
- Integration tests: <10 seconds execution  
- E2E tests: <60 seconds execution
- All tests pass in CI without flakiness
- New developer can run tests in <2 minutes setup
