# NeoAlchemy Testing Strategy: Execution Order

## GitHub Issues Created

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Execution Possible)
- **Issue #2**: 🧪 Separate unit tests from database dependencies
- **Issue #3**: 🧪 Create integration test structure  
- **Issue #4**: 🐳 Add test containers for reliable database setup

### Phase 2: Organization (Sequential, depends on Phase 1)
- **Issue #5**: ♻️ Reorganize existing tests into proper categories
- **Issue #6**: 🚀 Create CI workflow for all test types
- **Issue #7**: 📊 Add test performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Polish (Depends on Phase 2)
- **Issue #8**: 📝 Documentation and developer onboarding

## Recommended Execution Order

### Week 1: Foundation
1. **Start with Issue #2** (Unit test isolation) - Most critical, enables everything else
2. **Parallel: Issue #4** (Test containers) - Independent, high value
3. **Then: Issue #3** (Integration structure) - Builds on #2

### Week 2: Organization  
4. **Issue #5** (Reorganize tests) - Requires foundation from Week 1
5. **Issue #6** (CI workflow) - Requires proper test structure

### Week 3: Enhancement
6. **Issue #7** (Performance monitoring) - Builds on CI workflow
7. **Issue #8** (Documentation) - Final polish

## Quick Start Commands (Post-Implementation)

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, no dependencies)
pytest tests/unit/                 # <1 second

# Integration tests (database required)  
pytest tests/integration/          # <10 seconds

# E2E tests (full stack)
pytest tests/e2e/                  # <60 seconds

# All tests
pytest                             # Runs all with proper isolation

# CI simulation
pytest --ci                       # Runs exactly what CI runs
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Unit test speed | Unknown | <1 second |
| Integration test speed | Unknown | <10 seconds |
| E2E test speed | Unknown | <60 seconds |
| New developer setup | 30+ minutes | <5 minutes |
| CI reliability | Unknown | >99% |

## Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing tests during reorganization
  - **Mitigation**: Move tests incrementally, validate at each step
  
- **Risk**: CI containers being unreliable
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust retry logic and health checks
  
- **Risk**: Performance budgets being too strict
  - **Mitigation**: Start with loose budgets, tighten over time

## Key Decision Points

1. **Test Container Choice**: Use testcontainers-python for consistency
2. **Database Isolation**: Each test gets fresh database state
3. **Parallel Execution**: Enable for integration/e2e where possible
4. **CI Strategy**: Fail fast on unit tests, comprehensive on integration
5. **Performance Budgets**: Start generous, tighten based on data

## Future Considerations

After basic implementation:
- Consider test sharding for large test suites
- Add mutation testing for test quality validation  
- Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- Add performance benchmarking beyond just timing
